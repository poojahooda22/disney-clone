Next.js "Disney Clone" project, I've implemented the header, which comprises three main components: genre, search, and toggle mode. For the genre, I used a dropdown from shadcn/ui. The main movie listing, which I'll showcase here, is sourced from the TMDB website, with the API key securely stored in a local .env file. For the search functionality, I utilized the form component from shadcn, along with the dark theme provider from the same library.
The main movie listings use the same API but with a different URL. On the homepage, movies are divided into three subcomponents: upcoming, top-rated, and popular. For this, I created a subcomponent for all the movies where movie details can be displayed.
